# Python-Number-Sorting
This is the longest and most entry-level code possible.
It sorts the 4 numbers from the largest to the smallest, 
and then finds the difference of the largest and smallest numbers, thanks to int and input.


If you want to remove the waiting times, remove the time.sleep texts.

If you want it to prevent this when the numbers are equal, remove the EQUALITY CONTROL SECTION line
